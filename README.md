# Free Blue Bikes Predictor

An on-going project for real-time prediction of the number of available Bluebikes in 4 Bluebike stations near my home in Boston using machine learning.

Used Bluebike data of 2 years (2023 and 2024) of historical Bluebike trip data and weather data (temperature and precipitation).

## Project Motivation

I use Bluebikes regularly to get around. However, at times there are no available blue bikes in certain hours, so I decided to make this project for fun to gain some insights into the blue bike usage of stations near my home.
