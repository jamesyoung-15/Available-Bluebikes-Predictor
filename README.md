# Free Blue Bikes Predictor

An on-going hobby application for making real-time predictions of the number of Bluebikes that will be available at 3 stations near my apartment in Boston using machine learning.

Used 14 months (2023 Dec to 2025 Jan) of historical Bluebike trip data and weather data (temperature and precipitation).

## Project Motivation

I use Bluebikes regularly to get around. However, at times there are no available blue bikes in certain hours, so I decided to make this project for fun to gain some insights into the blue bike usage of stations near my home.
