# Free Blue Bikes Predictor

An on-going hobby application for making real-time predictions of the number of Bluebikes that will be available at 3 stations near my apartment in Boston using machine learning.

## Project Motivation

I use Bluebikes regularly to get around. However, at times there are no available blue bikes in specific stations for certain hours of the day.

So, I made this project for fun to gain some insights into commuting patterns for blue bikes near my home so that I know when and which stations are likely to have available bikes when I leave my home.

## Project Info

### Problem Formulation

### Dataset

I will be using Bluebikes trip history data from 2024, as one of the station was just recently opened in mid-December 2023. Unfortunately, I do not believe there is a recorded historical record of number of available bikes in stations, so I can only estimate the departures and arrivals into a station based on trip data history.

For weather, I will just be considering temperature and precipitation for now, although I may add other features like wind speed in the future. 

Below are the data sources:

- [Hourly Weather Data](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/historical-weather-api#latitude=52.52&longitude=13.41&hourly=temperature_2m,precipitation&daily=&models=)
